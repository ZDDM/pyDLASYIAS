Here is a guide on how to name the images.

*If the image has one or more animatronic/s...*
	
	The name of the image should have the first letter of the animatronics
	in the picture. For example, if Bear and Chicken are in one image, the
	image should be named like "bc.png"
	Always do it in this order: "bear/rabbit/chicken/fox"
	More examples: "brc.png", "rc.png"...
	"But what if the image has different versions?"
	Then name the picture like this: "bcr-1.png" or like this "b-1.png"

*If the image has no animatronics...*

	The name of the image should be numbers!
	For example, if a image has 3 different versions it should be named
	like this: "0.png" "1.png" "2.png"
	Easy!
