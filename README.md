pyDLASYIAS (pyDon't let animatronics stuff you in a suit)
========================================================


Welcome! This is the Github page for pyDLASYIAS (pyDon't let animatronics stuff you in a suit).

In this page, you can check the game's source code as well as the sprites and other things.

You can also fork it and make your own version of it!


"But, what is pyDLASYIAS?"

pyDLASYIAS is a "Five Nights at Freddy's 1" open-sourced clone.

Its objective is to recreate the original game in Python 3 with PyGame.

            *Camera Button            89 % (Sometimes has a few bugs...) 
            
            *Indicators

            *Changing camera                    93 % (Needs a static that stays for a few moments when changing     cameras...)
