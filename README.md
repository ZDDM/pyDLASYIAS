pyDontLetAnimatronicsStuffYouInASuit
====================================

pyDontLetAnimatronicsStuffYouInASuit (or PyDLASYIAS for short) is a text-based clone of Five Nights at Freddy's,
an horror game developed by Scott Cawthon.
Basically, as in the original game, you've got to keep the animatronics away from you using doors,
lights and cameras without using too much power.

===================================

So the game itself is made in Python 2.7.8, with no extra dependencies at all.
To run it you only need to install python (2.7.8) and run play.bat (Also you may need to edit a line inside pyDLASYIAS.py. The line is "debug = True". Change that to "debug = False")
