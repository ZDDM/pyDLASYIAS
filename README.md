pyDLASYIAS (pyDon't let animatronics stuff you in a suit)
========================================================

pyDLASYIAS is a text-clone of the horror game Five nights at Freddy's.
This "text-clone" aims to recreate the gameplay from the original game and make it fully customizable.
The game needs python 3+ to run. It will also always be free and open-sourced.

=======================================================

How to play: Well, playing is easy. You'll probably have some text with the power/time written in it.
You type commands like: "left door" "left light" "cam"
Now, to close or open the doors you simply write "left door" or "right door" and it will close or open the door.
You can do the same with the lights. You write "left light" or "right light". If there's something or someone in there, it will
tell you ;)
Here's a list of commands/synonyms you can write: "left door / dl, right door / dr, left light / ll, right light / ll, help, cam / camera, etc."
Oh, by typing "cam" or "camera" you enter in camera mode. A list of cameras will be shown and you write the name of the camera you wanna check. For example, "cam1c" or "cam5". Again, it will show you if something/someone is there.
You can exit from camera mode writing "exit" or "e".
And that's all, I think. Have fun playing!
