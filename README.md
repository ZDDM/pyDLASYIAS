pyDLASYIAS (pyDon't let animatronics stuff you in a suit)
========================================================


Welcome! This is the Github page for pyDLASYIAS (pyDon't let animatronics stuff you in a suit).

In this page, you can check the game's source code as well as the sprites and other things.

You can also fork it and make your own version of it!


"But, what is pyDLASYIAS?"

pyDLASYIAS is a "Five Nights at Freddy's 1" open-sourced clone.

Its objective is to recreate the original game in Python 3 with PyGame. 



"Five Nights at Freddy's" is a game made by Scott Cawthon. I don't own any of the sound nor the images.

I will take it down if Scott asks me to take it down.

I plan to change all of the images and sounds to some cool placeholders when the game is finished. 


I don't own Pyganim neither. Here is their webpage! http://inventwithpython.com/pyganim/
